# OpenClassrooms-P11-VeilleTechnologique

As we approach the final project at OpenClassrooms, we're diving into a crucial topic: Technology Watch.

As developers, the world of technology moves at a rapid pace, requiring us to stay updated in order to stay on top of our game. 
In this project, we explore practical solutions to achieve that. 
One such solution is Feedly, a fantastic tool that allows us to create a customized dashboard to follow and read articles from our chosen accounts.
We've also discovered the value of Twitter as an excellent tool for staying informed. 
By creating an account and following interesting accounts in our field, we can access a wealth of valuable insights and information.

By adopting these practices, we're embracing continuous learning and ensuring we're equipped with the latest knowledge to excel in the dynamic realm of technology.
